      We were delighted to be part of two projects recognised by our industry colleagues at The Natural Stone Awards this year.

      We supplied the Swaledale Fossil block stone to McConnells for their Highly Recommended prestigious new build project in Newry and we were one of the stone suppliers to Stonewest as part of their Commended St Paul’s Cathedral Equal Access project.

      A big thank you to The Stone Federation and all involved. Here’s hoping 2023 brings more of the same.
