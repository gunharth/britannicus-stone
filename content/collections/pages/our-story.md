      We create the shining stones of Britain. 

      We celebrate our love for British stone, yet very few people recognise its true worth. So, now is the time for Britannicus to shine! By nurturing our stone from the moment it leaves the quarry, we create the shining stones of Britain.

      We celebrate our love for British stone. 

      Britain's unique geology is a raw material of rare natural beauty. Polishing reveals a true character which we want everyone to appreciate as much as we do. So, we take a unique approach to the industry, which unites all factions to champion all that British stone can offer, for everyone to enjoy.

      Yet, very few people recognise its true worth. 

      Most decorative stone used in the UK is imported, because too few architects, specifiers and customers have discovered British stone. As an industry, we've made it too easy for competitor materials and producers to sell themselves much better. So, now is the time for Britannicus to shine.

    right_copy: 'Our stone comes from highly regulated and environmentally sustainable UK quarries with a social license. Our stone products can be recycled over and over again, so changes in the Building Regulations - combined with a renewed drive to buy the very best of British - makes Britannicus Stone the natural choice today.'
