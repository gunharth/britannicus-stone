    copy: 'Britannicus Stone’s products primarily come from carboniferous limestones which date back to the Dinantian epoch, about 350 million years old and which were originally laid down when Britain sat over the equator. Carboniferous Limestone is a sedimentary rock made of calcium carbonate.'

    copy: 'It is generally light-grey in colour and is hard. It was formed in warm, shallow tropical seas teeming with life. The rock is made up of the shells and hard parts of millions of sea creatures, some up to 30 cm in length, encased in a carbonate mud. Fossil corals, brachiopods and crinoids are very much in evidence as components of Carboniferous Limestone; indeed the rock is full of fossils.'

    copy: 'Carboniferous Limestone has horizontal layers (beds) with bedding planes and vertical joints. These joints are weaknesses in the rock which are exploited by agents of both erosion and weathering. They also lead to the most important characteristic of Carboniferous Limestone – its permeability. Water seeps through the joints in the limestone creating a landscape geologists call karst – underground streams and gorges. The Carboniferous Limestone has been folded and faulted by massive earth movements which can be seen by the fact that the rocks are now above sea-level and no longer horizontal. The rocks generally dip (slope) gently eastwards and, in some places, clear folds in the rock can be seen.'

    right_copy: 'British stone also has many advantages over other European limestones’ in that they are still comparatively intact as they have not been subjected to the same extremes pressures and temperatures over geological time. Though now hard and cemented, internally the stones remain today much as when they were deposited – tropical marine sediments packed with unaltered calcitic fossil fragments.'

    copy_1: 'The colour variations, so characteristic of British stones, are part of this same alteration process (metamorphism) which redistributes the various chemical compounds present in the original limestone throughout the new crystalline fabric. Reds and yellows are a result of the presence of various iron compounds, blacks contain organic carbon, greens include copper compounds and whites are almost pure calcium or magnesium carbonate.'
    copy_2: 'When polished British carboniferous limestone is often referred to as Shining Stone because of the way it takes a polish. The resulting colour spectrum on the stones is unique and beautiful, one that so perfectly suits the British light and interiors; neither garish nor dull, its palette is perfectly in tune with these islands landscape'
