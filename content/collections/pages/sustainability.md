    copy: 'We take our responsibility to be as environmentally sustainable as possible very seriously and even though Stone is already ahead of almost all building materials in its green credentials, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to continue to innovate and drive the environmental costs of using stone ever downwards. Our message is clear: Stone is environmentally the right choice and will continue to be so.'

      As part of this we have launched a revised version of our Sustainability Statement which all members are asked to sign up to. Stone Federation members are encouraged to:

      1.	Act 
      Be proactive in implementing sustainability, ethical sourcing, environmental and carbon reduction policies within their business. 

      2.	Measure 
      Measure their carbon, environmental and supply chain impact including business operations, material extraction and production. 

      3.	Disclose 
      Be transparent about their carbon, environmental and supply chain impact and the ways in which they are working to reduce this and ensure that the information is accessible to clients

      4.	Target
      Be specific in targeting areas where they can reduce the carbon and environmental impacts of their business. These target areas should be at least in line with the Government’s own Net Zero Carbon targets for the construction industry (78% reduction in emissions by 2038, 100% reduction in emissions by 2050). 

      5.	Adjust 
      Continue to measure and assess their progress against their carbon, environmental and supply chain goals and adjust practices where necessary.
