    copy: "British Land chose British stone by Britannicus for its reception areas and staircases.\_The natural synergy of the brands was represented by using Britain's Swalterwath stone from Cumbria. The chocolate brown stone with its beautiful swirls and flecks of white calcite gave a warm and luxurious\_appearance to these landmark offices in central London."
