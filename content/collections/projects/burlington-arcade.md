          64,000 pieces of stone were used to refurbish this magnificent and iconic walkway in central London. The pattern was a combination of one found in Greenwich Palace and a Trompe l'oeil decorated floor in Florence.

          Designed by Samuel Ware and built in 1819, the Burlington Arcade is a slice of ornate Regency architecture in the heart of London. In order to keep it at the forefront of West End shopping, the Arcade's owners wished to raise its cultural profile. As part of this vision, they commissioned Jamie Fobert Architects to design a new floor. Built in 2015 entirely from British stone, the new floor is historically-referenced yet truly contemporary.

        copy: 'The result has been a rhythmic interlocking, three dimensional design that reflects the arcade''s curvilinear forms found on the arches and grill work of the building. 150 tonnes of stone were used in the construction of the walkway including Moorcroft, Ashburton and Mendip'
