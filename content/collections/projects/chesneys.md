          The subtle shades of colour and movement in these materials are both unique and beautiful, ranging from the monochromatic contemporary hues of Frosterley stone to the vibrant semi-precious amethyst tones of Ball Eye Blue marble.

          Specifying a Fire Surround from our British Materials Collection is an opportunity to introduce a unique element to the interior design of a room and enjoy a timeless reminder of the archaeological history of our national landscape, whilst fostering homegrown artisanal masonry skills and our domestic quarrying industry.
