          The speciality and hallmark of David Collins Studio is its ability to create a residential feeling in retail. It’s done so here via 200 bespoke furniture pieces, a palette of red, blue and black at designated intersections, the use of artwork by Alex Innes and David Collins Studio’s Sam Wood; a mix of materials, such as metal and timber, British and Italian marble across floors and fixtures, the use of digital displays and acute attention to lighting. It’s one part an old-school gentleman’s club to another a modern man cave.


          “It doesn’t feel like you’re necessarily walking around a typical department store anymore,” says Simon Rawlings, creative director of David Collins Studio. “There are places that you can pause, places that you can engage with products in ways that you wouldn’t normally engage.”
