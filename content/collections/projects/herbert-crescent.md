        copy: 'The main bathroom used the very rare Ball Eye Blue creating a sublime and restful space, whilst another had a basin carved from a solid block of Ashburton which was offset by a complementary stone floor and wall panels. The wine cellar incorporated Hopton whilst fireplaces used Mendip. Throughout this impressive house only the world’s very best products and designers were employed; the net result being a house of true splendour.'
