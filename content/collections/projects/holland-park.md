          Simpson Studio completed this stunning renovation of a listed Holland Park mews house, putting British design and materials at the forefront.  The project, completed in January 2023 for a private client, involved an exhaustive overhaul of the space, including stripping it back to the brickwork and reconfiguring the layout.

          The ambition was to create a contemporary yet sympathetic space to bring colour and life back to the property. The design centred around the kitchen and dining space on the ground floor, leading up to an airy sitting room on the first floor.

          One of the key elements of the design was the use of British materials. Most notably, British Stone from the Britannicus Stone collection. Simpson Studio utilised rich, striking marble surfaces in a range of tones, including Stoneycombe in the kitchen, Moorcroft in the shower room, Ledmore for the bespoke console, and Swaledale to complement the London Plane timber joinery in the sitting room.
