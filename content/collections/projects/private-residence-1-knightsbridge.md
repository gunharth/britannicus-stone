    copy: "After a total refurbishment by leading architects, Tim Flynn architects, this 8-storey town house is arguably one of London’s finest residences. British stone was used throughout the house\_including each step and rise of the 169 step circular staircase. The main bathroom used the very rare Ball Eye Blue creating a sublime and restful space, whilst another had a basin carved from\_a solid block of Ashburton which was offset by a complementary stone floor and wall panels. The wine cellar incorporated Hopton whilst fireplaces used Mendip. Throughout this impressive\_house only the world’s very best products and designers were employed; the net result being a house of true splendour"
