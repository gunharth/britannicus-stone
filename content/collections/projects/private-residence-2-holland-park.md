    copy: "A cornucopia of stones were used to refurbish this glorious 4-storey stucco fronted house in central London. The stunning cantilevered staircase used Hopton Wood; the entrance hall's\_chequerboard floor was in contrasting Hopton and Salterwath as were the bespoke fireplaces; the master bathroom floor used Anglesey, whilst the vanity units were Swaledale."
