          'Old Bond Street is probably one of the most prestigious retail locations in the world. And for me being born and bred in London and having our business headquarters there and design studio, it’s incredibly prestigious for us; and I feel we’ve arrived.’ 
          — Stella McCartney

          Celebrating a love of nature, ‘Stella Rocks’ is a bespoke indoor rockery installation on the ground floor consisting of black Stanhope Black limestone from a quarry in Durham and rocks straight from the McCartney farm in Campbeltown.

          'Staying true to our commitment to sustainability and innovation, every effort has been made to move away from traditional luxury materials, using handmade, organic, and sustainably sourced elements in the new store design to echo the same approach as our collections. Reiterating a sustainable approach to design.' Stella says.

          ‘Sustainability is a massive part of what we do as a brand and therefore also a massive part of this store.’
