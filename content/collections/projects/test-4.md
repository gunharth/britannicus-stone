        copy: 'Flint House is a domestic dwelling on the Waddesdon Estate, Buckinghamshire, England. It was commissioned by Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and completed in 2015, winning that year''s RIBA House of the Year Award.[1] The architect was Charlotte Skene Catling, a partner of Skene Catling de la Pe√±a. The stones for the exterior were hand-knapped by master flint knappers John Lord and Simon Williams in Norfolk.[2] The interiors were decorated and furnished by David Mlinaric, using an eclectic mix of modern contemporary pieces and older items from the Rothschild collection. The ethos of the house is that it blends and harmonises with the surrounding landscape and environment.'
