  Anglesey is a geologistâ€™s dream with abundant stone including the
  renowned Anglesey Marble. This beautiful mid-grey marbled stone
  with fine calcite veins was used to build Birmingham Town Hall and the
  Menai Bridge.

  There is now only one marble quarry left and Britannicus Stone has exclusivity
  to the remaining polishing bed. 3.5m lengths can be achieved.
