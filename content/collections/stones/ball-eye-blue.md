  Ball Eye Blue is simply one of the rarest of all British stones; it is also extremely beautiful. Quarried in Derbyshire, Ball Eye Blue is a rare vein of Limestone/Fluorite conglomerate. The vein in the marble varies in colour from Amethyst on the outer edge of the deposit to Royal Blue towards the middle.

  The density of Fluorite increases at the centre of the deposit intensifying the vivid blue colouration. There is currently only one single block of Ball Eye Blue available. It is the true jewel of Derbyshire.
