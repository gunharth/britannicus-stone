  Dumfries Red is another shining stone sourced in Scotland. But unlike Ledmore, this is a brecciated conglomerate rather than a true marble. Being a conglomerate, it is made up of many crushed stones all held together by a natural cement. The Dumfries Red, when polished, has segments the colour of garnet, mixed with varying shades of red through to grey and blue.

  As with many of Britannicus’s stones, the polishing beds have not been widely used before and so are new to the market.
