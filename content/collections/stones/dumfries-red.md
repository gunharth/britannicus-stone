description: |-
  Dumfries Red is another shining stone sourced in Scotland. But unlike Ledmore, this is a brecciated conglomerate rather than a true marble. Being a conglomerate, it is made up of many crushed stones all held together by a natural cement. The Dumfries Red, when polished, has segments the colour of garnet, mixed with varying shades of red through to grey and blue.

  As with many of Britannicusâ€™s stones, the polishing beds have not been widely used before and so are new to the market.
