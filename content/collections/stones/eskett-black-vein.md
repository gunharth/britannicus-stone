description: |-
  Traditionally, Eskett is an aggregate quarry supplying crushed stone
  for industrial applications and there is no history of this limestone being
  used in buildings. Britannicus Stone has secured access to the polishing
  beds that contain a variety of intriguing mottled coloured stones
  and, for the first time, the true beauty of what Eskett quarry has to offer
  is revealed.

  From the light and dark greys of Eskett Light, the blood red of Eskett
  Red through to the rare Veined Black, these stones, when cut and polished,
  produce some of the most beautiful ‘marble’ in the British Isles.
