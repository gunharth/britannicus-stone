  Britannicus Stone offers a British marble that is quarried from the banks of the River Wear in Durham.

  The dark grey to black marble known as Frosterley marble is another British stone that comes to life when polished. It has white fossils running throughout produced from a tropical seabed some 325 million years ago.

  This marble has been quarried from the valleys around Frosterley since the 12th century and in the earlier years was used in a variety of northern England decorative pieces on high status buildings such as Bishop Pudseyâ€™s Great Hall, Bishop Auckland Castle and, most famously, Durham Cathedral.
