description: |-
  The renowned Derbyshire stone, Hopton Wood, has been used extensively on the floors of Chatsworth House, aka ‘The Palace of the Peak District’ (17th century) and The Houses of Parliament. It was laid in conjunction with a native black stone (which is no longer available) to create the first chequerboard floor in England.

  Hopton Wood limestone is light beige/white in colour, with its unique and beautiful characteristics brought to life when polished.
