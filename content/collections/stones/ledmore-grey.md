  This impressive stone from the Ledmore Quarry in Sutherland is the only marble quarry on mainland Britain, the other is on the Isle of Skye. The Ledmore Grey marble contains large white veins made up of calcium compounds, black veining originating from organic compounds and brown veining from copper compounds.

  With the initial deposits laid down 600 million years ago, the veining is comparatively young at 430 million years. The creation of this stone occurred when syenite igneous rock thrust its way up through the Durness Limestone deposits creating Serpentine and Brucite, the colours of which are brought to life with polishing.
