description: 'Moorcroft Cartoon is one of Britannicusâ€™ most extraordinary stones because of its interesting and nonfigurative patterns. Sourced in Plymouth the stone has significant variations produced by mineral clustering and colouration. Looking like an abstract impressionist painting by Rothko, the slabs have a wonderful combination of daubed blues and greys with contrasting orange and red veins.'
slab_sizes: 'Typical slabs are 1.6m x 1m; however they can vary.'
